<h4 align="center">I am an electronic engineer who is always willing to learn new things and a believer of self-development in any field. I like to listen people's experiences, as i think experience is something we cannot buy. I have been studying on programming since I was a student at university and currently working as a software engineer. That is why, I involved many projects and want to develop myself more in this field. As I like to search and share, I consider myself as a team player. Knowledge is something that increases when shared. There is no end for sharing and learning!</h4>
